"""
utils/scoring_universe.py — which symbols we are willing to SCORE.

Search spans ~12.6k US-listed symbols (utils/symbols.py). Scoring must not.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The Confluence Score is a macro-correlation model. Running it over the whole
listed universe would produce confident-looking numbers for instruments where the
model is meaningless:

  • leveraged / inverse ETPs  — "Direxion Daily SOFI Bull 2X", "Corgi RKLB 2x"
      Their returns are a mechanical multiple of an underlying, reset daily.
      A macro correlation on them describes the multiplier, not the economy.
  • plain ETFs / ETNs / funds — baskets, not companies. (The handful of
      macro-relevant sector ETFs we DO want are already in the curated 280.)
  • warrants, units, rights, preferreds — derivative or hybrid claims whose price
      is driven by the terms of the instrument, not the macro backdrop.
  • SPACs / blank-check shells pre-deal — trade at trust value, near-zero macro beta.

For a product positioned on precision, a fake number is worse than an honest
"not scored yet". Everything excluded here stays fully SEARCHABLE and can still be
analysed on demand — it just doesn't get a precomputed score it hasn't earned.

This module is deliberately pure + offline (name/flag heuristics only). The second
gate — sufficient price history and liquidity — needs price data and belongs in the
scoring worker, not here.
