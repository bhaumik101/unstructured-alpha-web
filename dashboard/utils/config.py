# 13F INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING — curated funds + hand-verified CUSIP map
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Why this exists as a hand-verified whitelist, not algorithmic fuzzy matching:
# SEC Form 13F filings report holdings by abbreviated company name + CUSIP --
# there is NO ticker symbol field anywhere in a 13F (confirmed live, 2026-06-21,
# by reading Berkshire Hathaway's, Pershing Square's, and Scion Asset
# Management's actual most-recent information tables). A free, reliable,
# keyless CUSIP->ticker lookup doesn't exist (OpenFIGI requires registration).
# Rather than fuzzy-match company names algorithmically -- which risks both
# false negatives (e.g. "ALLY FINL INC" vs "Ally Financial Inc") and, worse,
# false positives (two different companies sharing a generic first word) --
# every mapping below was built by manually reading each fund's real filing
# and confirming the CUSIP against this product's existing TICKERS universe.
# This trades coverage (only tickers already in TICKERS, and only positions
# these specific funds happen to currently hold) for actual correctness.
#
# CURATED_FUNDS: well-known, publicly notable institutional managers chosen
# for filing-size feasibility (small enough to fully fetch and verify by
# hand) and style diversity, not for being the "best" funds to track.
# Bridgewater Associates was deliberately excluded after live-checking their
# actual filing: it runs an extremely diversified macro/options-overlay book
# (largest 13F infotable.xml file checked ran ~600KB, alphabetically still
# only through "ATI" after the the portion fetched) -- far too large to read
# in full and hand-verify, and a single name appearing in a 3000+ position
# book is a much weaker "smart money" signal than a concentrated holding.

# Funds investigated and deliberately NOT added, for the record:
#   - Bridgewater Associates: too large/diversified to hand-verify (see note
#     in fetch_13f_holdings' docstring).
#   - Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn): most recent 13F-HR on file is
#     2024-02-14 -- over 2 years stale as of this writing, likely
#     deregistered or restructured its filer entity. Stale data presented
#     as current would be worse than no data.
#   - Third Point, Appaloosa Management: could not resolve a working CIK via
#     EDGAR's company-name search at the time this was built (that search
#     endpoint was intermittently returning empty results live, separate
#     from these specific funds' actual filing status -- worth retrying
#     later rather than concluding they don't exist on EDGAR).

# CUSIP -> ticker, hand-verified against each curated fund's most recent
# real 13F-HR information table. As of 2026-06-21: Berkshire & Pershing
# Square & Tiger Global period 2026-03-31 (filed 2026-05-15); Duquesne
# period 2025-12-31 (filed 2026-02-17); Scion period 2025-09-30 (filed
# 2025-11-03) -- Scion's is the most recent filing that fund has on record,
# so their data is genuinely older/staler than the others; this is
# disclosed in the UI, not hidden.

# NOTE: "quantum", "critical_minerals", "defense_aerospace", "biotech_longevity",
# "cybersecurity", "robotics_automation", and "water_security" categories were
# removed — each had zero genuine signals left in it after the equity-basket
# "proxy" signals were cut. The tickers for those themes still exist in TICKERS
# and are tracked using real macro signals (see notes above); they just don't
# need their own empty signal-category tab on the Signal Dashboard.
