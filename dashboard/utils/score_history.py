# utils/score_history.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Historical Score Snapshots
#
# WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: every score on this site, before today, was a
# pure point-in-time computation -- nothing remembered what a ticker's
# score was yesterday or last month. That blocks three things the
# 2026-06-22 roadmap calls for: a Score History chart on Ticker Deep
# Dive, a future public track-record page, and alert deltas compared
# against a real stored value instead of whatever the last alert
# happened to see. This module is the foundation all three sit on.
#
# NOT user-scoped, deliberately: a ticker's Confluence Score at a given
# moment is the same number for every visitor, so utils/db.py's
# score_snapshots table is keyed by (ticker, day), not by user.
#
# NO BACKGROUND SCHEDULER: this is a Streamlit app with no cron. History
# accumulates only for tickers someone actually opens on Ticker Deep
# Dive, upserted at view time -- organic, traffic-driven coverage, not a
# guaranteed daily record across the whole signal universe. That's a
# real, honest limitation worth stating plainly wherever this data is
# displayed, not glossed over.
