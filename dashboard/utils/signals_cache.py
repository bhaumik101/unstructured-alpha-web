"""
utils/signals_cache.py — single shared signal-scoring cache.

PROBLEM SOLVED:
  Before this module, five separate pages each had their own @st.cache_data
  function that iterated over all ~40 SIGNALS and called fetch_signal_series +
  score_signal independently:
      home_page.py        _home_load_all()            ttl=7200
      1_Signal_Dashboard  load_all_signals()          ttl=3600
      2_Today_Digest      compute_all_signal_scores() ttl=7200
      12_Sector_Map       _compute_sector_scores()    ttl=7200
      6_Stock_Screener    load_all_signal_scores()    ttl=3600

  Even though fetch_signal_series has its own cache (so HTTP calls are not
  repeated within the TTL window), each page's scoring function had a DIFFERENT
  cache key, so:
    - User A opens Home           → home cache warms, scores computed once
    - User B opens Signal Dash    → SEPARATE cache key, scores computed again
    - User C opens Stock Screener → SEPARATE cache key, scores computed AGAIN

  With a single shared function, all five pages draw from the SAME cache entry.
  One set of score computations per 6-hour window, regardless of which page
  the first visitor lands on.

USAGE (all five pages now do this):
    from utils.signals_cache import get_all_signal_scores
    all_sv = get_all_signal_scores()

RETURN SHAPE per signal_id key:
    {
      "score":         float,    # 0–100
      "status":        str,      # "bullish" | "bearish" | "neutral" | "insufficient_data"
      "z_score":       float,
      "percentile":    float,
      "current":       float,
      "mean_52w":      float,
      "std_52w":       float,
      "deviation_pct": float,
      "trend_4w_pct":  float,
      "config":        dict,     # raw SIGNALS[sig_id] entry
      "data":          pd.Series,# full raw fetch (for sparklines in Signal Dashboard)
      "name":          str,
      "category":      str,
      "tier":          int,
      "pcs":           int,
      "unavailable":   bool,    # True when no trustworthy real observations exist
      "error":         bool,     # True if fetch/score raised an exception
    }

The "data" key is included so Signal Dashboard can render sparklines without a
second fetch call. Other pages simply ignore it. The incremental pickle cost (~2MB
for 40 Series) is negligible vs. the saved API round-trips.
