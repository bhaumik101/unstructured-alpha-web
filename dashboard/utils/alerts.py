# utils/alerts.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Alert Evaluation Engine
#
# Compares each watched ticker's CURRENT state (Confluence Score, price,
# 52-week high/low, and the three differentiator-signal statuses) against
# the LAST-SEEN snapshot stored in utils/alerts_db, and turns meaningful
# deltas into alert records.
#
# Deliberately evaluates threshold CROSSINGS, not levels: if a ticker's
# score is 70 (bullish) on every check for a month, that should fire once
# (when it first crossed 65), not every single time someone reopens the
# Alerts page. Re-alerting on every check a condition merely continues to
# be true would make the feed useless noise within a day.
#
# Execution model: Streamlit has no built-in background scheduler -- this
# runs synchronously when called (e.g. when the Alerts page loads, or from
# a manual "check now" button), not on a timer while the app is closed.
# True push delivery (email) requires an actual scheduled job outside the
# Streamlit process; this module is the trigger logic that job would call,
# but the scheduler itself is explicitly out of scope for this pass (see
# pages/alerts page docstring for the current state of that gap).
