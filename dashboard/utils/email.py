# utils/email.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Verification Email Sending (Resend)
#
# Endpoint/payload shape verified live against Resend's published API
# reference before writing this, 2026-06-21:
#   POST https://api.resend.com/emails
#   Authorization: Bearer {api_key}
#   {"from": "...", "to": [...], "subject": "...", "html": "..."}
#   -> {"id": "..."}
# Plain requests.post, not Resend's Python SDK -- consistent with every
# other third-party integration in this codebase (FRED, EIA, SEC, FINRA all
# use requests directly), and avoids adding a dependency just to wrap one
# REST call this small.
#
# Configuration -- environment variable checked FIRST, st.secrets as a
# fallback (same priority order as FRED_API_KEY/EIA_API_KEY in
# utils/fetchers.py and DATABASE_URL in utils/db.py). This matters beyond
# consistency: st.secrets only exists at all under Streamlit Cloud's
# secrets.toml mechanism, so a host without that (Render, Railway, a plain
# VPS) needs the env var path to work, not just a fallback that happens to
# never get reached:
#   RESEND_API_KEY   -- required to actually send mail.
#   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL -- optional; defaults to Resend's own test sender
#     ("onboarding@resend.dev"), which only works for sending TO the email
#     address on the Resend account itself, not arbitrary recipients --
#     real signups need a verified sending domain configured in Resend and
#     that address set here.

    TEMPORARY DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING (added 2026-06-22, remove once the "emails
    aren't arriving for arbitrary recipients" issue is confirmed fixed):
    the FIRST version of this logging never showed up in Render's logs at
    all, even though a fresh, fully-observed incognito test confirmed
    signup() really was completing successfully (the "We emailed a code"
    UI message only renders when no exception was raised) -- and the
    GitHub source for the exact deployed commit was checked directly and
    does contain these print() calls. That combination only makes sense
    as a well-known Python/Docker gotcha: stdout is FULLY buffered (not
    line-buffered) when it's not an interactive terminal, which is always
    true for a containerized process whose stdout is piped into a log
    collector -- so print() output can sit in an internal buffer
    indefinitely in a long-running server process that never naturally
    exits, instead of ever reaching the log stream. flush=True on every
    print() below forces each line out immediately rather than waiting
    on Python's buffer to fill.
