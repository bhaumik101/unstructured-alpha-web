# utils/validation_status.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Consolidated Model Validation Status
#
# WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: every score this product computes (macro signals,
# insider activity, short interest, 13F, the Confluence/Supercycle
# composites) has gone through a DIFFERENT amount and kind of real
# validation -- some backtested with real significance numbers, some
# explicitly NOT validated and documented as such, some validated only
# per-ticker on demand rather than as a single global number. This module
# is the single, honest source of truth for "how validated is X, exactly,"
# pulling from the actual scoring/backtest functions rather than
# restating anything from memory -- every claim below traces back to a
# real function call or a docstring that was re-read at the time this was
# written, not approximated.
#
# backtest_all_macro_signals() was moved here from pages/8_About.py
# (previously a page-local function) so the new Model Validation
# Dashboard (pages/11_Model_Validation.py) and the About page's signal
# library both call the exact same implementation -- duplicating this
# logic across two pages would risk them silently drifting out of sync
# with each other, which is exactly the kind of inconsistency a
# "validation" feature cannot afford to have.

    """
    The universal lag-validation rollout (2026-06-22): every macro/FRED-
    style signal now gets the SAME rigorous treatment that was previously
    only built for insider activity and short interest --
    lag_scan_with_validation()'s out-of-sample split + Bonferroni
    correction, pooled_lag_scan_across_sector()'s cross-ticker
    confirmation, and compute_signal_reliability_score()'s transparent
    0-100 score with full component breakdown. This is a NEW, more
    rigorous validation pass alongside (not a replacement for)
    backtest_all_macro_signals() above -- that simpler same-sample
    significance test still backs the "Static PCS" backtest column on the
    About page, and nothing about live confluence-score weighting
    (utils/ticker_score.py) changes here. This function exists
    specifically for the Model Validation Dashboard's headline claim:
    every signal, validated the same rigorous way, no exceptions.

    Design: for each signal, the FIRST relevant ticker is the "primary"
    validation (mirrors how a ticker's own Deep Dive page treats insider/
    short-interest -- current ticker = primary), and up to 4 more relevant
    tickers form the pooled cross-ticker confirmation set -- mirroring
    sector-peer pooling exactly, just using the signal's own hand-curated
    relevant_tickers instead of utils.config.TICKERS sector groupings
    (more appropriate here: a signal's relevant_tickers were chosen
    specifically because the signal is thought to apply to them).

    Returns {signal_id: {"validation": ..., "pooled": ..., "reliability": ...}}.
    Every signal gets an entry, even with zero testable tickers or a fetch
    failure -- never silently omitted, so a caller's "N of M validated"
    count is never quietly wrong.
