# utils/lead_time_research.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Lead-Time Research for Alt-Data Signals
#
# WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM utils/analysis.py's EXISTING
# LAG-SCAN: the Ticker Deep Dive page already has a "Deep Correlation Scan
# — Lead Time Optimizer" (compute_correlation()) that tests lags 0-16 weeks
# against the macro/FRED-style signals and reports whichever lag produces
# the strongest correlation. That tool has never been applied to the
# alt-data differentiator signals (insider activity, short interest) at
# all -- this module extends the SAME underlying methodology to those,
# while fixing two real statistical problems that the existing tool does
# not address:
#
#   1. MULTIPLE COMPARISONS: scanning 17 lags and reporting whichever one
#      looks best is a textbook way to manufacture a false positive --
#      with 17 independent tests at p<0.05, you'd expect roughly one to
#      look "significant" purely by chance even if there's no real
#      relationship at all. This module requires the best lag to survive a
#      Bonferroni-corrected threshold (alpha / number of lags tested)
#      before treating it as a real finding.
#
#   2. OVERFITTING: a lag that looks great on the data it was discovered in
#      tells you nothing about whether it generalizes. This module always
#      splits the history chronologically -- finds the best lag using only
#      the earlier ~70% of history, then tests that SAME lag (not a
#      re-optimized one) against the held-out, more recent ~30% it has
#      never seen. A relationship that doesn't hold up out-of-sample is
#      reported as such, not quietly dropped.
#
# A third problem -- a relationship that only shows up for one specific
# ticker is much more likely a coincidence of that ticker's own history
# than a real, generalizable lead-time effect -- is addressed by
# pooled_lag_scan_across_sector(), which runs the same validated scan
# across a ticker's sector peers (via utils.config.TICKERS) and pools the
# results the same way compute_backtested_pcs() already pools macro-signal
# backtests across multiple tickers.
#
# compute_signal_reliability_score() combines all of the above into a
# single 0-100 number -- but, deliberately, NOT as another opaque score:
# it always returns its component breakdown alongside the number, so a
# user (or this app's own UI) can see exactly why a given lead-time finding
# scored the way it did. The entire point of this feature is to be more
# transparent than a black-box composite score, not to build a fancier one.

# answers "is there a real lead-time relationship, validated once, on the

# institutional quants call it "alpha decay": once a signal becomes well
# known, the market tends to price it in faster, so a lead time that was
# genuinely 8 weeks two years ago can compress to 2 weeks today as more

# SEQUENCE of trailing windows, rather than once across all of history,
# is how you'd actually notice that happening.
#
# THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT TREATED AS ANOTHER "VALIDATED" FINDING. Each
# window's best lag is an in-sample pick with no out-of-sample check of
# its own -- doing a full OOS split inside every rolling window would
# need far more history than almost any signal here has. Adjacent windows
# also overlap heavily by construction (a 13-week step inside a 104-week
# window shares ~88% of its data with the previous window), so this is a
# descriptive/exploratory view of a trend, not a statistically independent
# sequence of tests. The UI built on this must say so, every time.
