utils/time_stops.py — how long a macro thesis should take, and when it's stale.

THE GAP THIS FILLS
------------------
A score of 72 says a case exists. It says nothing about *when* it should show up
in the price, or when you should conclude it didn't. Without that, a call can sit
open forever and be quietly re-justified — which is how conviction becomes
stubbornness. Every signal already carries `lag_weeks` (how far ahead it has
historically led price), so the horizon is derivable today.

WHAT IT IS — AND ISN'T
----------------------
This is an EXPECTED WINDOW derived from configured lead times, not a prediction
and not a stop-loss. `lag_weeks` is a research estimate of a signal's typical
lead, so the honest claim is "signals like these have historically led price by
about N weeks", never "this will resolve by <date>". We say the former.

The central estimate is the MEDIAN, not the mean: lead times run 1–52 weeks with
a couple of long-tail outliers, and one 52-week signal would otherwise drag a
4-week thesis out to a year.

Only the signals actually FORMING the case are counted (the bullish ones behind a
bull call, the bearish ones behind a bear call). Neutral signals aren't part of
the thesis, so including them would blur the window.
