# utils/auth_ui.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Login/Signup/Email-Verification UI
#
# Per explicit user request, this app no longer gates every page behind a
# forced login wall. Most pages are browsable by anyone; only the
# Watchlist page (inherently per-account) still calls require_login() to
# require one. Everywhere else, app.py calls the non-blocking
# try_restore_session() so a returning logged-in user is still recognized
# (via the "remember me" cookie or an already-active tab session), without
# ever forcing an anonymous visitor through a gate. The top-right account
# widget (render_account_widget(), called from utils/header.py on every
# page) is how an anonymous visitor signs in or creates an account
# voluntarily, from anywhere in the app -- not a forced first step.
#
# st.session_state["user"] is the source of truth for "who's logged in"
# WITHIN the current browser tab session -- but that alone resets on
# every browser restart, which is the exact "log in over and over" problem
# the "remember me" cookie below fixes. Streamlit itself still has no
# built-in cookie API (st.login()/st.user are OIDC-only, delegating to an
# external identity provider like Google -- a different mechanism
# entirely from this app's own email+password accounts, not a drop-in fit
# here), so this uses the third-party streamlit-cookies-manager-v2
# component instead. st.session_state["pending_verification_email"]
# tracks an account that exists but hasn't entered its emailed code yet --
# set right after signup, or when login() reports EmailNotVerifiedError.
#
# Cookie component lifecycle, the part that's easy to get wrong: the
# CookieManager's underlying browser component needs one render round-trip
# before cookies.ready() is True. try_restore_session() returns None if
# not ready yet rather than blocking the page -- a deliberate tradeoff:
# someone with a valid remember-me cookie might see one render pass as
# "not logged in" before the cookie data arrives and the very next rerun
# (e.g. the header widget) picks them up correctly. That's a strictly
# better tradeoff than the old behavior of st.stop()-ing every single page
# load until the cookie component responds, now that pages aren't gated.

    the server, a browser tab left open from before the restart can

    the new process has NO session_state for at all, including
    "_cookies_this_run", which app.py otherwise sets unconditionally at
