    st.markdown("""
    Unstructured Alpha is an alternative data intelligence platform built for serious retail
    investors who want institutional-grade signal analysis without a Bloomberg Terminal subscription.

    The premise is straightforward: the most predictive market data is not price data. It is
    physical economic activity — freight volumes, energy contracts, labor dislocations, credit
    spreads — that reflects the real economy weeks or months before it appears in earnings reports
    or analyst forecasts.

    Hedge funds have known this for two decades. They pay $50,000–$500,000 annually for
    proprietary datasets from satellite imagery companies, credit card processors, and
    geolocation firms. We replicate the same *analytical logic* using free government data
    sources: the Federal Reserve, the CFTC, the SEC, the Census Bureau, and the BLS.

    The result is a dashboard that can answer: "What does the physical economy look like right
    now for this specific stock?" — not what the price chart looks like.

    st.markdown("**Signal Construction**")
    st.markdown("""
    Each signal is constructed through a four-step process:

    1. **Data collection** — Raw series fetched from FRED, CFTC, SEC EDGAR, or Yahoo Finance
       on each page load. Where possible, data is cached for 1–4 hours to reduce API calls.

    2. **Normalization** — Each series is z-scored against its own trailing 52-week history.
       This makes signals comparable across different scales and units.

    3. **Scoring** — The z-score is converted to a 0–100 signal score. A score of 50 means
       the series is at its historical average. Above 65 is bullish; below 35 is bearish.
       Inverse signals (e.g., jobless claims) are flipped: a rising claims number scores
       lower, not higher.

    4. **Confluence** — Multiple signal scores for a given ticker are combined using a
       weighted average, where each signal's Predictive Confidence Score (PCS) serves as
       its weight. Higher-quality signals have proportionally more influence on the
       final confluence score.
    """)

with m2:
    st.markdown("**Lead Time Optimization**")
    st.markdown("""
    The most important feature of alternative data is *when* it leads price. A signal that
    predicts prices 8 weeks ahead is much more actionable than one that correlates
    contemporaneously.

    The Deep Correlation Scan on the Ticker Deep Dive page runs an automated lag scan from
    0 to 16 weeks. For each lag, it computes the Pearson correlation between the signal
    (at time T) and the stock price (at time T + lag). The lag with the highest absolute
    correlation is identified as the "optimal lead time."

    This approach mirrors the lag-optimization methodology described in Kolanovic &
    Krishnamachari (2017), "Big Data and AI Strategies," J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research.
    """)

    st.markdown("**Confluence Scoring**")
    st.markdown("""
    The Confluence Score (0–100) aggregates independent signals into a single alignment metric.
    When 5–7 unrelated signals from different data domains (trucking, credit, labor, energy)
    all currently read the same direction, that is a stronger *description* of the present data
    than any single signal alone — but see the Backtest Results section directly below before
    treating that description as a forecast.

    - Score >65 = Signals currently aligned bullish
    - Score 35–65 = Mixed / low agreement
    - Score <35 = Signals currently aligned bearish

<div style="background:#FFF0F0;border-radius:6px;padding:14px 18px;border:1px solid #E8B4B4;
            font-size:0.86rem;color:#5D2020;margin-bottom:8px;font-family:Georgia,serif;line-height:1.7;">
We walk-forward backtested the actual scoring functions above (not a simplified version — the
real production code) against 6 tickers spanning the Power Supercycle thesis (CEG, VST, NEE, ETN,
VRT, PWR — chosen because none are mechanical constituents of any signal being tested, e.g. URA's
largest holding is Cameco, so CCJ was excluded to avoid circularity), at ~19 monthly checkpoints,
using only data available as of each checkpoint date (no lookahead).

<b>Result:</b> pooled across all 6 tickers (96–108 observations depending on horizon), there is
no statistically significant relationship between either score and 1/2/3-month forward returns
(all |r| &lt; 0.07, p &gt; 0.5). Two of the six tickers — the two with the most narrative-extended,
momentum-driven price action in the test window — showed a significant <i>negative</i> relationship
in isolation (high score coincided with a cyclical top, not a forward rally); the other four showed
no significant relationship in either direction. None of the individual-ticker results survive
correction for testing multiple tickers/horizons at once.

<b>What this means in practice:</b> these scores are an honest, real-time read of how many
independent alternative-data signals currently agree — useful context, and the methodology behind
them (lag-scanning, statistical significance filtering on individual signals, PCS weighting) is
sound. But the combined score has not been shown to predict forward price moves, on this sample.
Treat it as descriptive, not predictive, until a larger backtest says otherwise. We are not hiding
this finding because it's the inconvenient one — building this product on a score we can verify
beats building it on a score that just sounds good.
