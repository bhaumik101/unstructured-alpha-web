"""
Config integrity checks for utils/config.py — SIGNALS, TICKERS, CATEGORIES.

These exist because this project has twice shipped a dangling reference:
once when oil_rig_count was removed but four tickers still listed it in
their "signals" list, and historically when FRED series IDs were guessed
rather than verified. These tests don't verify the series IDs are REAL
(that requires a live network call against FRED/EIA, which a unit test
shouldn't depend on) — but they do catch every dangling-reference and
missing-required-field class of bug for free, instantly, offline.
