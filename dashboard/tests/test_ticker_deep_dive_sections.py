"""
Tests for the Ticker Deep Dive segmented-control restructuring
(pages/3_Ticker_Deep_Dive.py).

Context: this page was originally one 1,351-line linear scroll. It was
split into 4 sections (Overview / Insider & Short Interest / 13F &
Federal Contracts / Deep Correlation Scan) selected via
st.segmented_control -- chosen deliberately over st.tabs() because a
live check (not an assumption) confirmed st.tabs() executes every tab's
code on every script run regardless of which tab is showing, while
branching on segmented_control's return value with if/elif genuinely
skips code for unselected sections.

The headline Confluence Score still depends on insider/short-interest/
13F/contracts data (they're baked into the composite at a fixed 12%
weight each -- see utils/ticker_score.py), so that part of the fetch
cost is NOT reduced by this restructuring and these tests don't claim
otherwise. What IS genuinely deferred: fetch_insider_trades(), a second,
separate call used only for the "all Form 4 filings" detail expander
(not used in scoring at all) -- that one only fires when the Insider &
Short Interest section is actually open, which is what the last test
below confirms directly.

    share one real (temp, file-based) SQLite DB for the whole session

    tests may have already visited the same default ticker (CCJ) earlier

    """
    Volume + RSI (added 2026-06-22, per explicit user request for "basic
    indicators" on Ticker Deep Dive) is gated behind `if not
    price_series.empty:`, same as the existing price chart/stats it sits
    alongside.

    KNOWN GAP, same root cause already documented in conftest.py's module
    docstring for the insider/short-interest validated-scan button: this
    sandbox has no real network access (confirmed live -- yfinance calls
    fail with a blocked-proxy error here), AND utils/ticker_score.py
    already holds its own bound reference to fetch_price from an earlier
    import in this test session, so monkeypatching
    utils.fetchers.fetch_price at this point would not reach it. That
    means price_series is genuinely empty in every AppTest run in this
    environment, and the actual Volume/RSI rendering with REAL data
    cannot be exercised here -- compute_rsi() itself is thoroughly unit-
    tested directly with synthetic ground truth instead (see
    tests/test_technical_indicators_unit.py), and the on-page wiring
    needs a live-browser check before trusting it, the same as this
    page's two st.fragment price tickers already do.

    What THIS test actually confirms: the empty-price-series path (every
    ticker, in this sandbox) renders without raising, which is real
    coverage even though it can't reach the non-empty branch.
