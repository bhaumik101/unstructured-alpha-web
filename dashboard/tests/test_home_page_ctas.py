Tests for the Home page's call-to-action buttons.

Added 2026-06-22 alongside the secondary "My Watchlist" / "Model
Validation Dashboard" CTA row -- before this, those two pages (2 of the
app's 9 routed pages) had no discoverable link from Home at all. This
file confirms all 5 CTA buttons (3 primary + 2 secondary) exist with
their expected keys and that clicking each one actually navigates,
rather than just trusting the button labels visually look right.
