"""
Every routed page must render with zero exceptions, with no API keys
configured (the worst case: every signal falls back to synthetic data,
every price fetch may fail). This is the single most important regression
test in this suite — it is the automated version of the manual "ast.parse +
AppTest across all pages" check that's been run by hand after every change
so far in this project. A bad series ID, a missing dict key in a fallback
path, or a KeyError in a chart builder should fail HERE, not get caught
days later by a user screenshot.
