"""
Unstructured Alpha — Signal Intelligence Dashboard
===================================================
Navigation router. Each page handles its own set_page_config.

Run locally:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    streamlit run app.py

Accounts: every page requires a logged-in user (see utils/auth_ui.py).
Deliberately does NOT call st.set_page_config() here -- every routed page
already calls it itself as that page's first Streamlit command, and
Streamlit only allows ONE set_page_config() call per script run. On a run
where the user isn't logged in yet, require_login() renders the login
form and calls st.stop() before pg.run() ever reaches a page, so no
conflict; on a run where they're already logged in, require_login()
returns immediately without rendering anything, leaving the routed page's
own set_page_config() call as the genuine first command.

st.navigation() is called BEFORE require_login(), deliberately. Calling it
draws the grouped sidebar (Home/Signals/Research/Market/Alerts/Info)
immediately as a side effect -- separate from pg.run(), which is what
actually executes the selected page's content. require_login() still
gates the content: if nobody's logged in, it renders the login form in
the main area and calls st.stop() before pg.run() below ever executes, so
no page content leaks pre-login. This was caught live, not assumed: with
the order reversed (require_login() first), st.navigation() never ran
on a not-logged-in script pass, so Streamlit fell back to auto-discovering
every file in pages/ and showed that flat, ungrouped list (complete with
two already-retired stub pages) instead of the intended grouped nav.
