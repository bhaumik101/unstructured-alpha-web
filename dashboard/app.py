"""
Unstructured Alpha — Signal Intelligence Dashboard
===================================================
Navigation router. Each page handles its own set_page_config.

Run locally:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    streamlit run app.py

Accounts: per explicit user request, this app does NOT require an account
to browse most of it -- only the Watchlist page (inherently per-account)
calls utils.auth_ui.require_login() itself, as that page's own concern.
Every other page is fully usable by an anonymous visitor. This file just
does a non-blocking session check (try_restore_session()) so a returning
logged-in user is recognized -- via the "remember me" cookie or an
already-active tab session -- without ever forcing anyone through a login
wall. The actual sign-in/sign-up affordance lives in the top-right of
every page (utils.header.render_account_widget(), called from each page's
own render_header()), reachable voluntarily from anywhere, not a forced
first step. Deliberately does NOT call st.set_page_config() here -- every
routed page already calls it itself as that page's first Streamlit
command, and Streamlit only allows ONE set_page_config() call per script
run.

st.navigation() is called first, drawing the grouped sidebar
(Home/Signals/Research/Market/Watchlist/Info) as a side effect -- separate
from pg.run(), which is what actually executes the selected page's
content. This ordering mattered even more under the old forced-login
design (a stale flat sidebar bug, since fixed) and remains the right order
now: the sidebar should never depend on auth state to render correctly.
