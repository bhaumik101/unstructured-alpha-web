# Unstructured Alpha Dashboard — Deployment Guide

## Running Locally (First Test)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Deploying as a Public Website (Streamlit Cloud — Free)

This is the fastest path to a live, public URL. **Free tier** supports unlimited public apps.

### Step 1 — Push to GitHub

```bash
# From the dashboard/ directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Unstructured Alpha dashboard"

# Create a new repo on github.com (call it: unstructured-alpha-dashboard)
# Then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unstructured-alpha-dashboard.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2 — Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to **[share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)** and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **"New app"**
3. Select your repo: `unstructured-alpha-dashboard`
4. Set main file: `app.py`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

Your app will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME-unstructured-alpha-dashboard-app-XXXX.streamlit.app
```

### Step 3 — Set up a hosted database (required for accounts)

Streamlit Community Cloud's filesystem is **not** persistent across redeploys/restarts —
every account, watchlist, and alert would vanish the next time the app restarts if it lived
on local disk there. A free hosted Postgres database fixes this. [Neon](https://neon.tech)
and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) both have generous free tiers; either works the same way:

1. Create an account at your chosen provider (this is a step only you can do — account
   creation isn't something this assistant can do on your behalf).
2. Create a new Postgres project/database.
3. Copy the connection string it gives you (looks like
   `postgresql://user:password@host/dbname`).

### Step 4 — Set up email verification (optional, but recommended)

New accounts get a 6-digit code emailed via [Resend](https://resend.com) before they can log
in. Without this configured, signup still works but the verification email silently fails to
send (the app tells the user this and lets them retry once it's fixed) — meaning nobody can
actually finish signing up. To enable real verification emails:

1. Create a free Resend account (3,000 emails/month free tier).
2. Get your API key from the Resend dashboard.
3. For real signups (not just testing), verify a sending domain in Resend and use an address
   on that domain as `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` below — Resend's default test sender
   (`onboarding@resend.dev`) only delivers to the email address on your own Resend account,
   not to arbitrary recipients.

### Step 5 — Add secrets

In Streamlit Cloud dashboard → **⋮ Settings → Secrets**:

```toml
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host/dbname"
RESEND_API_KEY = "re_your_key_here"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL = "Unstructured Alpha <noreply@yourdomain.com>"

FRED_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
EIA_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
```

Get a free FRED API key at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
Get a free EIA API key at: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php
(Both take about 2 minutes, completely free, no credit card)

Locally, none of these are required — the app falls back to a local SQLite database (for
accounts/watchlists) and synthetic demo data (for FRED/EIA signals) when they're not set.

## Custom Domain (Optional — makes it look professional)

Streamlit Cloud supports custom domains on all plans.

1. Buy a domain (e.g., `unstructuredalpha.com`) from Namecheap or Cloudflare (~$10/year)
2. In Streamlit Cloud: Settings → Custom domain → enter your domain
3. Add a CNAME record in your domain registrar pointing to Streamlit's URL

Result: `https://dashboard.unstructuredalpha.com`

## Password Protection (For Paid Subscribers)

To gate the dashboard behind a password for Substack subscribers:

### Option A: Streamlit built-in secrets check (simplest)

Add to `app.py` before any other content:

```python
import streamlit as st

def check_password():
    def password_entered():
        if st.session_state["password"] == st.secrets["APP_PASSWORD"]:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = True
            del st.session_state["password"]
        else:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = False

    if st.session_state.get("password_correct", False):
        return True

    st.text_input("Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password")
    if "password_correct" in st.session_state:
        st.error("Incorrect password")
    return False

if not check_password():
    st.stop()
```

Add to Streamlit Cloud secrets:
```toml
APP_PASSWORD = "your-subscriber-password"
```

### Option B: Individual subscriber tokens

For paid tier where each subscriber gets a unique token:
```python
VALID_TOKENS = set(st.secrets.get("subscriber_tokens", "").split(","))
token = st.text_input("Enter your access token:")
if token not in VALID_TOKENS:
    st.stop()
```

## Updating the App

Any push to the `main` branch auto-deploys to Streamlit Cloud. No manual action needed.

```bash
# Make changes locally, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Add new signal / update data"
git push origin main
# Streamlit Cloud redeploys automatically in ~30 seconds
```

## Data Refresh Schedule

| Data Source | Update Frequency | Streamlit Cache TTL |
|---|---|---|
| FRED (trucking, rail, jobless claims) | Weekly/Monthly | 1 hour |
| yfinance (stock/commodity prices) | Daily | 30 min |
| CFTC COT | Weekly (Friday) | 24 hours |
| USASpending.gov (federal contracts) | Real-time | 2 hours |
| SEC EDGAR (insider trades) | Within 48h of filing | 1 hour |
| arXiv paper velocity | Daily | 24 hours |
| EIA (crude inventories, gas storage) | Weekly | 1 hour |
| openFDA (drug approvals) | Real-time | 24 hours |
| FINRA (short interest, exchange-listed) | Bi-monthly (~2-3wk publish lag) | 12 hours |

Data is **cached** using `@st.cache_data` with these TTLs — the app won't re-fetch on every page load.
Users can force a refresh by pressing Ctrl+R.

## Embedding in Substack / Ghost

You can embed the dashboard in a newsletter post using an iframe.
Most hosted newsletter platforms support iframe embeds in posts.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://YOUR_APP.streamlit.app"
  width="100%"
  height="900"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="fullscreen">
</iframe>
```

Or just link to it: *"Access the live dashboard at dashboard.unstructuredalpha.com →"*
