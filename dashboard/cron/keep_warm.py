cron/keep_warm.py — Keep the Render web service warm.

Free/low-tier Render web services spin down after ~15 min of inactivity; the
next visitor then hits a cold container, which is what produces the transient
"Page not found — Running the app's main page" flash on shared deep-links
(Streamlit re-runs before pages finish registering). A lightweight GET every
few minutes keeps the container alive so real visitors always land on a warm
app.

Scheduled from render.yaml (every 10 minutes). Best-effort: never raises, so a
transient network blip can't mark the cron run as failed.

Env:
  APP_URL — public base URL of the web service.
            Defaults to https://app.unstructuredalpha.com
