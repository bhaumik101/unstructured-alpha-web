# cron/send_score_moved.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Score-Movement Email Cron
#
# Runs once daily (11:30 AM ET / 15:30 UTC via Render Cron).
# For every verified user who has at least one watchlist entry, it computes
# the current Confluence Score for each watched ticker and compares it against
# the last score we emailed them about (stored in alert_state.last_score_emailed).
# If any ticker has shifted ±10 or more points since that baseline, the user
# gets a single batched email summarising all moved tickers.
#
# WHY a separate field (last_score_emailed) instead of reusing last_score:
#   The hourly threshold-crossing cron (send_watchlist_alerts.py) updates
#   last_score on every run -- so if we used that as the baseline here, the
#   delta we'd see is only the movement since the *last hour*, not since the
#   last time we alerted the user about a meaningful trend shift. A 10-point
#   move spread over several hours would never be detected. last_score_emailed
#   is only updated by THIS cron, so it captures true multi-day deltas.
#
# FIRST-RUN BEHAVIOUR: If last_score_emailed is NULL (new ticker, or first time
# this cron has run for an existing user), we store the current score as the
# baseline and send no email. The user gets alerted on the *next* run if the
# score subsequently moves ±10pts from that baseline.
#
# IMPORTANT: This script runs OUTSIDE Streamlit. Do NOT import anything that
# calls st.* at module level. Configuration is read from environment variables
# (DATABASE_URL, RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM_EMAIL, FRED_API_KEY, EIA_API_KEY),
# which Render injects identically for the web service and all cron jobs.
#
# Run manually (from the dashboard/ directory):
#   python -m cron.send_score_moved
# or:
#   python cron/send_score_moved.py
