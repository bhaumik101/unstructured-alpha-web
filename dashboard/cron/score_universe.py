# cron/score_universe.py
# Unstructured Alpha — Batch Confluence-Score Worker
#
# Precomputes Confluence Scores for the qualifying universe (~5.3k common stocks,
# see utils/scoring_universe.py) and writes them to score_snapshots, so Deep Dive,
# the screener and the recommender READ a score instead of computing one cold.
#
# WHY THIS IS TRACTABLE
#   The 47 macro signals are ticker-INDEPENDENT. They're fetched once and reused
#   for every ticker in the run (via the module-level cache in utils/fetchers),
#   so the marginal cost per ticker is a batched price fetch plus correlation
#   math — not 47 more network calls.
#
# DESIGN RULES
#   • Runs OFF the interactive path — this is a cron/worker, never the web process.
#   • Bounded: chunked batch fetches, a hard ticker budget, and a wall-clock
#     deadline, so a run can't grow without limit or overlap the next one.
#   • Memory-safe: prices are released and the heap trimmed between chunks.
#   • Idempotent: record_score_snapshot upserts on (ticker, snapshot_date), and a
#     FAILED compute never writes — so a bad run cannot overwrite good data.
#   • Isolated per ticker: one bad symbol never aborts the run.
#
# TIERS (cadence lives in render.yaml, not here)
#   core : the curated tickers + everything users actually watch  → run daily
#   rest : the remaining qualifying universe, rotated in daily slices so the whole
#          universe is refreshed over --rotate-days without scoring 5k every day
#
# Run manually (from dashboard/):
#   python -m cron.score_universe --tier core --dry-run
#   python -m cron.score_universe --tier rest --rotate-days 7

# Memory guard. Render killed the first core run nine minutes in with
# "Ran out of memory (used over 512MB)". Crons inherit the Starter plan (512MB)
# unless render.yaml gives them one, and the web service's `plan: standard` does
# not apply to them.
#
# Measured on this codebase (scripts/measure_cron_memory.py):
#   imports alone ......... 208MB  (pandas 77, scipy 56, yfinance 26, streamlit 31)
#   + all 47 signals ...... 268MB
#   + a 120-symbol chunk .. 232MB  (the price frame itself is only 0.5MB)
#
# So the fixed cost is ~270MB and the price frames are negligible; what remains
# is consumed gradually while scoring hundreds of tickers through the full path.
# The run already had a wall-clock deadline but no memory guard, so it was killed
# rather than stopping — and an OOM kill loses the entire run, which then repeats
# identically the next night. Stopping cleanly banks whatever was scored and lets
# the next run continue, so the universe fills in over several days instead of
# never.
